# Godot-Project-Template

This template removes the repetition and pain of creating the Main Menu, Loading Screen, Pause Menu, and Options Menu for your Godot 4 Project.
Right now there is no UI theme. Feel free to copy this template and apply your own theme to the UI. Hopefully, this can save someone a few hours 
during a Game Jam.
